        <p class="center"><strong>This is a dummy post with dummy content that is meaningless for the sake of playing with simple blog design.</strong></p>
        <p>We use a simulator based on real-world data in our training stack to train the model in-loop. The car’s movement in the simulator needs to be as close to reality as possible (or at least unbiased), for the model to easily transfer to the real world. Luckily, the dynamics are simple when going straight, but get complicated during turns. Since the car is a rigid body, the lateral (sideways) motion of the car depends on the velocity, yaw-rate, and a host of car-specific parameters like tire stiffness and center-of-gravity position. Previously, we approximated out a lot of these effects, which resulted in a consistent bias in the simulator in turns. So, the model trained on this biased simulator had a fairly consistent turn-cutting effect when driving in the real world. Improving the dynamics model in the simulator and the lateral planner reduced average turn-cutting bias by ~40%.</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago, we noticed an uptick of malfunctioning fans in the field. We traced this down to a new batch of fans used in recently built comma three’s. This batch of fans uses a new fan control chip, and this chip’s stall detection feature was tripping erroneously. Once the stall detection trips, the fan control chip doesn’t try to drive the fan anymore. We added our own stall detection in the panda fan driver, which allows us to recover the fan control chip when it gets in a bad state (commaai/panda#1022). We also added a PID controller on the fan’s RPM to ensure all fans behave similarly.</p>

        <p>Here’s what the MTBF report had to say about 0.8.15, the previous release, after a month in the field. This is the first release where all the individual unplanned disengagement event types have an MTBF greater than 1000 hours. Overall MTBF of unplanned disengagements is also up to 550 from 330 hours.</p>
        <p>Laikad is a new process running on the device that enhances the existing positioning system by processing raw GPS signals. The first feature noticeable to the user in the latest release is the faster startup of navigation, since the position of the device is found much earlier compared to the position directly outputted by our u-blox GNSS module. In the future, our localizer will use the processed GPS measurements from laikad directly to obtain a more accurate estimate of the position and motion of the car.</p>

        <p>The UI has new translations for Japanese thanks to cydia2020 and Brazilian Portuguese thanks to AlexandreSato. The following contributors made improvements to the existing translations: crwusiz, cydia2020, eFiniLan, and ponzu07. If you’d like to contribute to openpilot’s translations, start here.</p>

        <p>You might be familiar with our previous blogpost describing all the building blocks that make openpilot drive your car. Laikad is a new addition to the family of daemons. Its main functionality is to listen to incoming GPS signals from satellites received by the u-blox module, determining the satellite positions and correcting time delay affects caused by the atmosphere and clock error of the GPS signal. These measurements are used internally in a Kalman filter to get a good estimate of the position and velocity. The end goal is to send the measurements to locationd (our localizer module) where they’re fused together with other sensor data (e.g. from an IMU) to increase the position accuracy.</p>
        <p>All these satellites have one-way communication to a GNSS receiver on the ground like your phone or a comma three. How do we turn the received information into a position? Each satellite carries a very accurate atomic clock. The satellite continually broadcasts a signal that includes the transmission time and a synchronization marker. When your comma three receives this signal it can figure out the time it took to travel in space by comparing it to its own clock. The difference between transmit and received time divided by the speed of light gets us the distance to the satellite. For example the travel time of GPS is at least 0.067 seconds: height of GPS (20.000km) / speed of light (~300.000km/s).</p>
        <p>Now that we have the distance to a satellite (which is called a pseudorange), we need to figure out where the satellite is located in space. Using the position of the satellite and the distance to it our position can be derived. Figuring out the satellite’s orbit can be done in two ways: receive it from the satellite which sends its ephemeris (aka trajectory) every 30 seconds or download the data from the internet. NASA publishes past and predicted orbits multiple times per day on an ftp server. These predicted orbits are more accurate than what’s broadcasted by the satellites themselves. laikad can use both, and prefers the one from the internet when it’s available.</p>
        <p>By using trilateration with pseudoranges of different satellites, we can calculate our position. Each position and distance to a satellite allows us to draw a sphere where we should be on. Three satellites should provide us the exact position on earth as can be seen in the image below. However there is one variable that we assumed to be correct: the clock of the satellite and our comma three doesn’t tick at the same speed which causes minor differences in time and large difference in distance. We need a minimum of four satellites to estimate this clock error variable.</p>
